# Static Site Generation

Static site generation is a process that takes content and templates and generates a static website. This process is often used for blogs, documentation, and other types of websites where the content does not change frequently.

One common problem we face with dynamic websites is that they can't be indexed by search engines. This is because search engines can't execute JavaScript, so they can't see the content that is generated by JavaScript. This is where static site generation comes in. By generating a static website, we can ensure that the content is available to search engines and users.
