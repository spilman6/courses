## Specifications

You are going to send me a "secret" message, using localStorage. Modify your site.js file so that when it runs, it adds a message to localStorage. The message should be a string, and it can be anything you want. It could be a simple message, or a joke, or a quote, or anything else you want me to see.

You must use the key `It's a secret to everybody.`. It must be spelled exactly like that, with the same capitalization and punctuation. If not, my code won't be able to find it. If I can't find it, you'll get a zero score, and a comment that says, "Message not received. Try again."

**500 brownie points** if you your message is a reference to something related to that key.

> [!NOTE] Just because something is a "secret" doesn't mean it's secure. This is just a fun exercise to practice using localStorage. Don't use localStorage for anything that needs to be secure. Using localStorage for secure data is like writing your password on a sticky note and putting it under your keyboard.

## Submission

Push your changes to your github.io repository. Remember that you are adding to an existing repository, so you don't need to use `git init`. The three commands you need to run are:

```bash
git add .

git commit -m "Added secret message"

git push
```

### Submitting to Blackboard

Once you have your website pushed to GitHub, submit the link to your GitHub Pages site to Blackboard.
