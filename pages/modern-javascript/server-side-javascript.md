# Server Side JavaScript

In this unit we are going to continue using Node.js to write server side JavaScript. We will also be importing modules (or packages) using npm. Finally, we will create our own custom modules.

# NPM

NPM is a package manager for JavaScript. It is used to install and manage packages. It is also used to manage dependencies in a project. 

NPM comes pre-installed with Node.js. To check the version of NPM installed on your machine, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm -v
```

## Using NPM and Installing Packages

Before we can import packages using NPM, we need to create a `package.json` file. This file contains information about the project and the packages that are used in the project.

To create a `package.json` file, you can run the following command in your terminal, then follow the prompts:

```bash
npm init
```

Now that we have a `package.json` file, we can start install and use packages in our project.

We're going to install a package called `ansi-colors` to demonstrate how to install packages using NPM.

`ansi-colors` is a package that allows you to add color to your terminal output. It is a great package to use when you want to add some color to your terminal output.

To install a package, you can use the `npm install` command followed by the name of the package. For example, to install the `ansi-colors` package, you would run the following command:

```bash
npm install ansi-colors
```

You can also shorten the install command to `npm i`:

```bash
npm i ansi-colors
```

This video will walk you through the previous steps, and then show you how to use the `ansi-colors` package:

            allowfullscreen allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture">
        ></iframe>
    </div>
</details>

Often times, npm packages will have documentation and examples on their NPM page. This is a great place to start when learning how to use a new package.

Here is the link to the [ansi-colors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ansi-colors) package on NPM. If you haven't already, take a minute to scan throught the documentation.

To use a package in your project, you need to import it into your JavaScript file. You can do this using the `require` function.

Here is the code from the video:

```javascript
const colors = require('ansi-colors')

console.log(colors.red("red text"))
console.log(colors.green("green text"))
console.log(colors.blue("blue text"))

console.log(colors.bgRed("red background"))

console.log(colors.black.bgWhite("black text, white background"))
```

> [!NOTE] The documentation uses the variable name `c` to import the `ansi-colors` package. I chose to use the variable name `colors` instead, because I think it makes the code more readable. You can use any variable name you like.

## Node Modules and .gitignore

When you install a package using NPM, it is stored in a folder called `node_modules`. This folder is created in the root of your project. It contains all the packages that are installed in your project.

This folder can get notoriously large. So much so, that it has spawned multiple memes. Including this one:

![node_modules meme](https://img.devrant.com/devrant/rant/r_1943782_8ezyM.jpg)

Because of this, it is common practice to not include the `node_modules` folder in your git repository. Instead, you can add a `.gitignore` file to your project and add the `node_modules` folder to it. This will prevent the `node_modules` folder from being included in your git repository.

This video will walk you through the process:

            allowfullscreen allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture">
        ></iframe>
    </div>
</details>

If you are cloning an existing project from a git repository, you will need to run the `npm install` command to install all the packages that are used in the project. This command will read the `package.json` file and install all the packages that are listed in it.

# Node Fetch

Node Fetch is a package that allows you to make HTTP requests in Node.js. It is similar to the `fetch` function that is available in the browser.

We are going to be using a specific version of the node-fetch package. This version is `node-fetch@2.7.0`. We are going to use this version because it uses the same `require` syntax, that we already have experience with.

			allowfullscreen allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture">
		</iframe>
	</div>
</details>

To install the `node-fetch` package, you can run the following command:

```bash
npm i node-fetch@2.7.0
```

And here is the code from the video:

```javascript
(async () => {

	const fetch = require('node-fetch')

	const url = 'https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/ditto'

	const response = await fetch(url)
	const json = await response.json()

	const { name, id, height, weight } = json
	console.log({ name, id, height, weight })
	
})()
```

# Exercise 1

</details>

The pokeAPI has a lot of information about pokemon. One of the things it has is "PokemonColor". According to the API:

> "Colors used for sorting Pokémon in a Pokédex. The color listed in the Pokédex is usually the color most apparent or covering each Pokémon's body. No orange category exists; Pokémon that are primarily orange are listed as red or brown."

For this exercise, I want you to make a variable called "color" that will contain the color of the pokemon. You will then use fetch to get all of the pokemon-species that match that color, and use the ansi-colors package to display the names of the pokemon in that color.

The url for the pokemon-species is:

```javascript
const url = `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon-color/${color}`
```

To get the console to log the correct color you can use the following code:

```javascript
console.log(colors[color](pokemon))
```

## Hints {#exercise-1-hints}

<details>
	<summary>How do I get the species of the pokemon based on color?</summary>

You can use the fetch function to get the species of the pokemon based on color. For example:

```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon-color/red') // get the "red" pokemon
const json = await response.json()
console.log(json)
```

</details>

<details>
	<summary>How do I get the name of the pokemon from the result?</summary>

The result object has an array called "pokemon_species". You can loop through this array to get the name of each pokemon. For example:

```javascript
const { pokemon_species } = json
pokemon_species.forEach(pokemon => {
	console.log(pokemon.name)
})
```

	const response = await fetch(url)
	const json = await response.json()

	const { pokemon_species } = json
	pokemon_species.forEach(pokemon => {
		console.log(colors[color](pokemon.name))
	})

})()
```

# Custom Modules

In addition to using packages from NPM, you can also create your own custom modules. A module is a file that contains JavaScript code. You can export code from a module using the `module.exports` object. You can then import the code from a module into another file using the `require` function.

This is a great way to organize your code and make it more readable.

This video will walk you through the process:

	</div>

## Exporting Classes

You can also export classes from a module.

This video will show you how:

		<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p6MdDkfURMw" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0"
			allowfullscreen allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture">
		></iframe>
	</div>
</details>

Here is the code from the video:

test-class.js:

```javascript
class Person {
	firstName

	constructor(firstName) {
		this.firstName = firstName
	}

	greet() {
		console.log(`${this.firstName} says hi!`)
	}
}

module.exports = Person
```

app.js:

```javascript
const Person = require('./test-class')
const ryan = new Person('Ryan')
ryan.greet()
```

> [!NOTE] `module.exports` is not the only way to export code from a module. You can also use `exports` instead of `module.exports`. It works a bit differently, but it is also a valid way to export code from a module, I just choose not to use it.

## Exporting Objects and Functions

You can also export objects and functions from a module. I find doing this is easier to understand than exporting classes. 

This video will show you how:

<details open>
	<summary class="video">Show/Hide Video</summary>
	<div class="video-container">
		<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fh6MxHPtTQc" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0"
			allowfullscreen allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture">
		></iframe>
	</div>
</details>

Here is the code from the video:

test-functions.js:

```javascript
const createPerson = firstName => {
	return { firstName }
}

const greet = person => {
	console.log(`${person.firstName} says hi!`)
}

module.exports = { createPerson, greet }
```

app.js:

```javascript
const { createPerson, greet } = require('./test-functions')
const ryan2 = createPerson('Ryan')
greet(ryan2)
```

Or if we just want to export a single function:

test-function.js:

```javascript
const createPerson = firstName => {
	return { firstName }
}

module.exports = createPerson
```

app.js:

```javascript
const createPerson = require('./test-function')
const ryan3 = createPerson('Ryan')
console.log(ryan3)
```

	</div>
</details>

For this exercise, I want you to create a custom module called `pokemon.js` that export a function. This function will return a random pokemon from the pokeAPI. You will then import this module into your app.js file and use the function to get a random pokemon.

## Hints {#exercise-2-hints}

<details>
	<summary>How do I create a custom module?</summary>

To create a custom module, you can create a new JavaScript file and export the code using the `module.exports` object. For example:

```javascript
const getRandomPokemon = async () => {
	return 'random pokemon'
}

module.exports = getRandomPokemon
```

Or you could do:

```javascript
module.exports = () => {
	return 'random pokemon'
}
```

</details>

<details>
	<summary>How do I import a custom module into my app.js file?</summary>

To import a custom module into your app.js file, you can use the `require` function. For example:

```javascript
(async () => {

	const getRandomPokemon = require('./random-pokemon')
	const pokemon = getRandomPokemon()
	console.log(pokemon)

})()
```

</details>

## Solution {#exercise-2-solution}

<details>
	<summary>Show the Answer</summary>

pokemon.js:

```javascript
const fetch = require('node-fetch')

const getRandomPokemon = async () => {

	const url = `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${Math.floor(Math.random() * 807) + 1}`
	const response = await fetch(url)
	const json = await response.json()

	const { name, id, height, weight } = json
	return { name, id, height, weight }
}

module.exports = getRandomPokemon
```

app.js:

```javascript

(async () => {

	const getRandomPokemon = require('./pokemon')
	const randomPokemon = await getRandomPokemon()
	console.log(randomPokemon)

})()
```
