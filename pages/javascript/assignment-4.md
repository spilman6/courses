## Specifications

Your website should have the following:

1. Create an index.html page that contains:
	- Your name
	- A photograph of yourself
	- A short bio about yourself
	- A list of your favorite movies or books

2. Style the page using CSS. You can use an external stylesheet or style the page using `<style>` tags in the `<head>` section of the page. You can be as creative as you want with the design, but at a minimum, you should:
	- Change the background color of the page
	- Change the font family and color of the text

3. Create a JavaScript file called `site.js` and link it to your page.
	- You can write an alert or a console message to test that the file is linked correctly, but otherwise the file should be empty.

## Submission

### Pushing to GitHub Pages

You're going to push your website to GitHub Pages. To do this, you will need to create a new repository on GitHub and push your files to it.

> [!IMPORTANT] Even if you have used GitHub before, you should follow the instructions below! There are some important steps when creating a GitHub Pages site that you may not be familiar with!

Things to remember when creating your repository:

1. Make sure your index page is named `index.html`. index.htm will not work! 

2. The name of the repository must be `<your GitHub username>.github.io`. For example, if your GitHub username is `johndoe`, the name of the repository must be `johndoe.github.io`.

3. Make sure you select "Public" when creating the repository.
