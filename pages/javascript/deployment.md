# Deployment

In this unit, we will take a look at how to deploy our JavaScript applications. You have already learned how to deploy a static website using GitHub Pages. In this unit, we will take a quick look at how you would deploy a full-stack application.

## Hosting a Full-Stack Application

When you deploy a full-stack application, you will need to host your files on a server. There are many hosting providers that you can use to host your application. Some popular hosting providers include:

- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/)
- [Railway](https://railway.app/)

As you can see, there are many hosting providers to choose from. Each provider has its own set of features and pricing plans. When choosing a hosting provider, you should consider the following factors:

- **Pricing**: How much does it cost to host your application on the platform?

- **Scalability**: Can the platform handle a large number of users? Will it need to?

- **Containers**: Does your application require containerization?
