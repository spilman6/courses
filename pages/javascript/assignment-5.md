# Assignment 5 - Array Methods

In this assignment, you will be given a starting array, and a "result" variable. You will be using the array methods to manipulate the starting array, and assign the result variable to the expected array. You will be given a function to test your work. The tests will check to see if the result variable is equal to the expected output. If it is, the test will pass. If it is not, the test will fail.

To get started, fork and clone down the following node project: [Assignment 5](https://github.com/RDAppel/js-assignment5).

Before you start, open the console and run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

This isn't necessary, but it will add colors to your test output, which makes it easier to read.

Also, be sure to turn off GitHub Copilot. It's a great tool, but it's not going to help you learn how to use array methods.

There is an example problem in the `example.js` file. You can run it with the following command:

```bash
node problems/example
```

More importantly, look at the code in the `example.js` file. It shows you how to structure your code to solve the problems.

## Specifications

Complete `problem-1.js` - `problem-4.js`. Each file contains instructions for that particular problem.

To test a specific problem, run the following command:

```bash
node problems/problem-1
```

Replace `problem-1` with the problem you want to test.

If you want to run all the tests, you can run:

```bash
node run-all
```

## Submission

Once you have completed the assignment, push your changes to your GitHub repository. Remember that you are adding to an existing repository, so you don't need to use `git init`. The three commands you need to run are:

```bash
git add .

git commit -m "Completed assignment 5"

git push
```

Once your code is pushed to GitHub, submit the link to your repository to Blackboard.
