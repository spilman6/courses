# Cloning a Repository

Cloning is the process of creating a copy of a remote repository onto your local machine, so you can work on it.

In this video, we will walk through the process of cloning a repository from GitHub:

	<div class="video-container">

			allowfullscreen allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture">
		</iframe>
	</div>
</details>

The command to clone a repository is:

```bash
git clone <remote-url>
```

# Forking a Repository

Forking is the process of creating a copy of a remote repository on your GitHub account. This allows you to make changes to the repository without affecting the original repository. Forking is commonly used in open-source projects, where you want to contribute to a project but don't have write access to the original repository.

In this video, we will walk through the process of forking a repository on GitHub:

> [!NOTE] If you want to follow along, the repository we are forking is [js-movie-api](https://github.com/fvtc/js-movie-api).

# Real-World Example

In this video I will talk about a real-world example of how you can use forking and cloning to contribute to an open-source project:

# Exercise 1

For this exercise, you will need to fork and clone the following repository:

- [vce-fork-exercise](https://github.com/fvtc/vce-fork-exercise)

Once you have forked and cloned the repository, open the `index.html` file in your browser. You should see a message that says "Version Control".

Next, open the `index.html` file in your text editor and change where it says "Version Control" to your name (it should be on line 14).

Save the file and go back to your browser. Refresh the page and you should see your name displayed on the page.

Finally, push your changes to GitHub.
