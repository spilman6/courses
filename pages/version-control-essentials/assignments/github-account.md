## Register or Sign In

If you already have a GitHub account, you can skip this step. If you don't have an account, you will need to create one.

1. If you are creating an account for the first time, choose a username that is professional and easy to remember. Many students use their GitHub account long after they graduate. It's not unheard of for potential employers to look at your GitHub account to see what kind of projects you have worked on.

2. You will also need to provide an email address. You can use your school email address or a personal one. It's really easy to change later if you need to.

3. [Click here](https://github.com/signup) to create a new account.

## Change your Avatar

Once you have created your account, you should change your avatar. It can be a picture of you, a cartoon character, or anything else that you like that is school/work appropriate. This will help personalize your account and make it easier for others to recognize you.

To change your avatar:

1. Go to [your settings/profile page](https://github.com/settings/profile).

2. Click "Edit" on the `Profile picture` on the right side of the page.

3. Click "Upload a photo" and select a photo from your computer.

# Submission

Once you have your GitHub account created and your avatar changed, submit the URL to your GitHub profile in Blackboard. The url should look like: `https://github.com/your-username`.
