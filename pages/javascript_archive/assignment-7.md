# Assignment 7 - To Do App

In this assignment, you will create a simple "To Do" API using Express. The API will allow users to view tasks, add new tasks, and mark tasks as complete.

> [!NOTE] You will be continuing to add to this project for Assignment 8, so keep it handy for the next unit!

## Getting Started

To get started, fork the [Assignment 7 Starter Code](https://github.com/RDAppel/js-assignment7) repository from GitHub, and then clone it to your computer. This repository contains a basic Express application with a single route that returns an index.html file.

> [!NOTE] Remember to run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.

## Requirements

Your task is to add the following routes to the application:

1. **GET /api/todos** - This route should return a list of all tasks in the "To Do" list. The response should be a JSON array of tasks.

2. **POST /api/todos** - This route should allow users to add a new task to the "To Do" list. The request body should contain the task item. Respond with the id of the new task as a JSON object, like this: `{ id: 4 }`.

3. **PUT /api/todos/:id** - This route should allow users to mark a task as complete. The route should accept a task ID as a parameter and toggle the task's `complete` property. Respond with a JSON object containing the updated task, like this: `{ id: 1, complete: true }`.

### Additional Hints

Remember that you can add to an array using the `push` method:

```javascript
const { item } = request.body
const id = todos.length + 1
const complete = false
todos.push({ id, item, complete })
```

To find and toggle the `complete` property of a task, you can use the following code:

```javascript
const { id } = request.params
const task = todos.find(todo => todo.id.toString() === id)
task.complete = !task.complete // toggle the complete property
```

## Testing

To test your endpoints, you can use the REST client extension. The project includes an `endpoints.rest` file with sample requests for each route.

## Submission

Once you have completed the assignment, push the changes up to GitHub and submit the link to your repository to Blackboard.
