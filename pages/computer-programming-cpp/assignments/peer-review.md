# Peer Review Guidelines

Read through the "Peer Review Guidelines" found [here](https://github.com/rdappel/courses/raw/refs/heads/master/support-files/cpp/Peer%20Review%20Guidelines.docx).

# Classroom Students

You will be completing this assignment in class. I will assign you a partner to review (probably a classmate that sits neer you). You will have time in class to review their code and provide feedback.

# Online Students

## Finding a Partner

After you have completed [Assignment 6 - Tic Tac Toe](https://fvtc.software/appel/computer-programming-cpp/assignments/tic-tac-toe), you will need to find a partner to review. I have setup a [Teams Channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3A22361d30392b4302bc18d9579cd626ee%40thread.tacv2/Peer%20Review%20-%20Online?groupId=ee1b6d24-5c8f-42ad-b178-cfe8ad4f69fe&tenantId=ae888c53-4d60-47da-a75a-c8a10f1d47b0) for this purpose.

## Explaining Your Code

You will need to record a 5-10 minute video explaining your code to your partner. You should walk through your implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game, explaining how you structured your code, and how you handled the game logic. You should also discuss any challenges you faced, and how you overcame them.

## Reviewing Your Partner's Code

After you have recorded your video, you will need to exchange videos with your partner. Watch their video, and take notes on their implementation. You should look for areas where they did well, and also provide suggestions for how they could possibly improve their code.

# Submission

Submit a half-page review of your partner's code. Include what you thought they did well, and what suggestions you have for improvement. Also include a link to your video explaining your code (online students only). The review should include:

1. A paragraph (2-3 sentences), that explains your initial thoughts on their code. Discuss what you thought they did well, and what areas you think they could improve, as well as things they did that were similar or different from your implementation.

2. A paragraph (2-3 sentences), about feelings you would have if you had to maintain their code. Discuss how easy or difficult you think it would be to understand and modify their code, and what suggestions you have for making it easier to maintain.

3. A paragraph (2-3 sentences), about the overall quality of their code. Discuss how well you think their code is structured, and what suggestions you have for improving the overall quality of their code.

You can submit a word document, or write your review as a comment in the assignment submission form. If you are an online student, you should also include a link to your video explaining your code.
