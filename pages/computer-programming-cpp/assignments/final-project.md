> [!IMPORTANT] Make sure that you have had your proposal approved by your instructor before starting work on your project!

## Contributing to the Project

1. **Fork the Repository**: Have one of your group members fork the [cpp-space-fighter-2](https://github.com/fvtc/cpp-space-fighter-2) and then add the additional members to the repository. Settings > Collaborators & Teams > Add Collaborators. cpp-space-fighter-2 is a copy of cpp-space-fighter, this is necessary because GitHub won't let you create multiple forks of a repository.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Each group member should clone the repository to their computer.

3. **Create a New Branch**: (Optional) Each group member should create a new branch for their work. Name the branch after the feature you are adding. For example, `new-enemy` or `power-up`.

4. **Implement Your Feature**: Work on your feature in your branch. Make sure to test your changes to ensure they work correctly.

5. **Merge Your Changes**: Once you are finished with your feature, merge your changes back into the `main` or `master` branch. If you need help with this, ask your instructor.

> [!NOTE] Each member must contribute to the codebase. You should be able to see each member's contributions in the commit history. "I helped with the design" or "I helped with the testing" is not enough to get a passing grade. You must have code in the project.


# Submission

When you are finished with your project, you will need to submit the following to Blackboard:

1. **Repository Link**: Provide a link to your group's repository on GitHub.

2. **Documentation**: In the submission comments on Blackboard, provide the following information:

   - Describe your contribution to the project. What feature(s) did you add or modify, and how did they affect the gameplay?
   
   - Describe any challenges you faced while working on the project and how you overcame them, or (if you didn't) what you would do differently next time.

   - Provide insight into your group's collaboration. How did you work together to complete the project? What roles did each group member take on? Did everyone contribute equally to the project?

# Grading

Your project will be graded based on the following criteria:

- **Functionality**: Does your feature work correctly? Does it add to the gameplay experience?

> [!NOTE] I will not grade broken builds. If your project does not compile or run, you will receive a 0, and I will leave a comment for you to fix it. This may mean that you need to comment out parts of your code to get it to compile and run.

- **Documentation**: Did you provide clear documentation of your work? Did you explain your contribution to the project?

- **Collaboration**: Did you work well with your group members to complete the project?
