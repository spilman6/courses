# Assignment 1 - GitHub Account

For this assignment you are going to create a [GitHub](https://github.com) account (if you don't already have one). This will be your primary means of submitting assignments for this course.

- If you already have an account, make sure that you know your login credentials.

- If you are creating an account for the first time, take care when choosing a username. There's a good chance that you'll want to use this after you graduate. [Join GitHub · GitHub](https://github.com/signup)

## Submitting

Once you have your GitHub account, submit the link (example: github.com/your-username) to Blackboard.
