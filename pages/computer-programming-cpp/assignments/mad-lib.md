# Assignment 3 - Mad Lib

For this assignment, you will create a Mad Lib program in C++. A Mad Lib is a word game where a player is prompted for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story before the story is read. The result is usually humorous.

## Specifications

Your program should include the following tasks:

1. Use the following Struct:

```cpp
struct Entries {
	string type;
	string input;
};
```

The struct `Entries` has two attributes:

- `type` (string): The type of word to be entered (e.g., noun, adjective, place, sport).
- `input` (string): The word entered by the user.

2. Create an Array of Entries:
   - Define an array that holds 10-15 entries.
   - Initialize the array with different types of words, and use an empty string for the `input` attribute.
   - Do not use a global variable for the array, it should be defined within the `main` function.
   - You can hard-code the Initial state of the array. For example:

```cpp
Entries entries[] = {
	{"place", ""},
	{"adjective", ""},
	{"noun", ""},
	{"famous person", ""},
	{"verb", ""},
	{"animal", ""},
	// Add more entries as needed
};
```

3. Prompt the User for Input:
   - Use a loop to iterate through the array and prompt the user to enter a word for each type.
   - Store the user's input in the `input` attribute of the struct.
   - Display a message indicating the type of word to be entered, allong with the current number of the word (e.g., "1. Enter a noun: ").
   - Use `cin` to read the user's input.

> [!NOTE] `cin` will stop reading input at the first whitespace character. If the user enters more than a single word, their input will be cut off. This is expected behavior. We will learn how to read entire lines of input in a future lesson.

4. Allow the user to fix any mistakes:
   - After the user has entered all the words, prompt them to fix any mistakes. They should be allowed to re-enter a word for a specific entry.
   - Allow the user to fix multiple mistakes if needed.

5. Display the Mad Lib:
   - Create a story with blanks for the user's input.
   - Use the user's input to fill in the blanks in the story.
   - Display the completed story to the user.

## Example Output

When completed, your output should look similar to:

<div class="no-copy">

```plaintext
1. Enter a place: McDonald's
2. Enter an adjective: smelly
3. Enter a noun: donut
4. Enter a famous person: Obama
5. Enter a verb: dunk
6. Enter an animal: turtle

Do you want to fix any mistakes? (y/n): y
Which entry would you like to fix? (1-6): 3
Enter a noun: doughnut

Do you want to fix any mistakes? (y/n): n

Your Mad Lib:
Yesterday, I went to McDonald's and saw a smelly doughnut. I asked Obama if he wanted to dunk, but he said he was busy walking his pet turtle.
```

# Submission

For submission, you will need to create a new repository on GitHub and push your code to it. You will then submit the link to your repository on Blackboard.

## Pushing to GitHub

Once you have created your repository on GitHub, push your code up using `git init`, `git add .`, `git commit -m "Initial Commit"`, followed by the lines from GitHub.

> [!TIP] Remember that in Bash, `Ctrl` + `V` will not paste! Use `Shift` + `Insert` instead, or right-click and select "Paste".

Verify that your code was pushed to GitHub by refreshing the page for your repository.

## Submitting to Blackboard

Once you have your project pushed to GitHub, submit the link to your repository to Blackboard.
