# Assignment 9 - Modification Proposal

For this assignment and the final project, you will be modifying the shoot-em-up game that you explored in the previous assignment. You will need to make changes to the game to create a new version of the game that is different from the original.

You will need to find a partner (or two) to work with on this project. You will be working together to make changes to the game, and you will need to coordinate your efforts.

I have setup a [Channel in Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3Ac5d3e121022943528ef8e2fbb2577e3e%40thread.tacv2/Final%20Project%20-%20Online?groupId=ee1b6d24-5c8f-42ad-b178-cfe8ad4f69fe&tenantId=ae888c53-4d60-47da-a75a-c8a10f1d47b0) for you to use to find a partner. You can also use this channel to ask questions and get help with the project.

> [!NOTE] Remember that I don't monitor Teams channels, so if you need help from me, you should tag me in your message.

## Proposal

You will need to create a proposal for the changes you want to make to the game. Your proposal should include the following:

1. Your name and your partner's name(s).

2. A description of the changes you want to make to the game. You should describe the new features you want to add, and how they will change the gameplay.

## Proposal Rejection

If I feel that your proposal is too easy, or doesn't change the game enough, I may ask you to revise it. Additionally, if I feel that your proposal is too difficult, or not feasible, I may ask you pick a different idea.

If your proposal is rejected, you will receive a 0 for the assignment, along with feedback on why it was rejected. You will have the opportunity to resubmit a new proposal.

Once your proposal is accepted, you will receive full credit for the assignment.

# Submission

You can submit this by simply writing your proposal in the assignment submission comments. You can also submit a text document if you prefer.
